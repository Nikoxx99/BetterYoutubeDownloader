**Download your favorite YouTube videos or audios easily and quickly with this intuitive desktop application.**

This application allows you to download YouTube content in MP4 (video) or MP3 (audio) format directly to your computer. It offers two modes of operation: download from a specific URL or batch search and download based on search terms.

Built with Python, `pytubefix` for YouTube interaction, and `CustomTkinter` for a modern and pleasant graphical interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Intuitive Graphical Interface:** Easy to use thanks to `CustomTkinter`.
*   **Single URL Mode:** Paste the URL of a YouTube video to download it.
    *   Automatic URL verification when pasting or typing.
    *   Video quality selection (progressive MP4).
*   **Batch Search Mode:** Paste a list of names or search terms (one per line).
    *   The application will search for each term on YouTube.
    *   It will automatically download the first result found for each term.
*   **Flexible Formats:** Download as MP4 video (with audio) or extract only the audio in MP3 format.
*   **Folder Selector:** Easily choose where to save your downloads.
*   **Progress Bar:** Visualize the download progress in real-time.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (as long as Python and Tkinter are installed).
